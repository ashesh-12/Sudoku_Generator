    "# Sudoku Generator: Initial Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the task of Sudoku solver next is Sudoku Generator and initially, the three methods that came to my mind were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backtracking with gradual removal**  \n",
    "   - Generate a fully solved Sudoku board using backtracking.  \n",
    "   - Gradually remove numbers from cells and replace them with `'.'`.  \n",
    "   - After each removal, check if the board remains uniquely solvable.  \n",
    "   - I think it Ensures uniqueness and validity.  \n",
    "   - But i do think it is Computationally expensive, as checking uniqueness after each removal could be cost ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradual construction with uniqueness checks**  \n",
    "   - Start from an empty board and gradually fill in numbers while maintaining uniqueness constraints.  \n",
    "   - **Pros:** Builds the board step by step with guaranteed validity.  \n",
    "   - **Cons:** Complex to implement and manage constraints efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformations on a base board**  \n",
    "   - Start from a pre-solved, valid board and generate variations using transformations such as rotations, reflections, or permuting numbers.  \n",
    "   - **Pros:** Fast and easy to generate multiple boards from a single base solution.  \n",
    "   - **Cons:** Limited to variations of the original base board; may reduce overall diversity and is dependent to the base board."
